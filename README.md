Late Show Management API
========================

The **Late Show Management API** is a Flask-powered application designed to handle data for TV show episodes, guests, and their appearances. This API simplifies the management of episodes, guest details, and their corresponding appearances. It offers a set of RESTful routes for handling **Episodes**, **Guests**, and **Appearances**, including validation, serialization, and HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) support for easy resource navigation.

Setup
-----

To get the Late Show API up and running, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local environment:

bash

Copy code

 `git clone https://github.com/your-username/lateshow-api.git`

Navigate into the project directory:

bash

Copy code

`cd lateshow-api`

1.  Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash

Copy code

`python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate`

1.  Install the necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

bash

Copy code

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

1.  Set up the database (SQLite by default):

bash

Copy code

`flask db upgrade`

1.  Launch the development server:

bash

Copy code

`flask run`

1.  The API will now be live at `http://localhost:5555`.

How to Use
----------

With the Late Show API, you can manage the following core entities:

-   Episodes
-   Guests
-   Appearances (the connection between episodes and guests)

### Available API Endpoints

#### Episodes

-   **Retrieve all episodes**:\
    **GET /episodes** -- This endpoint provides a list of all episodes and the appearances within them.

-   **Retrieve a specific episode**:\
    **GET /episodes/int:id** -- Returns details of an individual episode, including the guest appearances linked to that episode.

#### Guests

-   **Retrieve all guests**:\
    **GET /guests** -- This endpoint lists all guests and their appearances on various episodes.

-   **Retrieve a specific guest**:\
    **GET /guests/int:id** -- Returns details of a specific guest, including the episodes they appeared in.

#### Appearances

-   **Create a new appearance**:\
    **POST /appearances** -- Establishes a new guest appearance on an episode. You'll need to provide the following data:

json

Copy code

`{
  "rating": 5,
  "episode_id": 1,
  "guest_id": 2
}`

-   **Retrieve an appearance**:\
    **GET /appearances/int:id** -- Provides details of a specific appearance, including related guest and episode data.

### Entity Relationships

The API models two primary relationships:

-   **Episodes ↔ Appearances**: Each episode can have multiple appearances (i.e., different guests appearing on that episode).
-   **Guests ↔ Appearances**: Guests can appear in multiple episodes, and each appearance contains information like a rating.

The **Appearance** model serves as the junction table between **Episodes** and **Guests**, capturing the many-to-many relationship.

Data Schemas
------------

The API uses `marshmallow_sqlalchemy` for managing serialization and validation. Below are the key schemas:

#### Episode Schema

-   **Relationships**:
    -   Serializes episode data, including its appearances.
    -   **HATEOAS Links**: Adds navigation links to the episode resource and related appearances.

#### Guest Schema

-   **Relationships**:
    -   Serializes guest information, including the episodes they appeared in.
    -   **HATEOAS Links**: Adds navigation links to the guest resource and their appearances.

#### Appearance Schema

-   **Validation**:
    -   Ensures the rating falls between 1 and 5.
    -   Validates that both `episode_id` and `guest_id` are provided.
    -   **HATEOAS Links**: Adds links to the appearance resource, as well as to the associated episode and guest.
